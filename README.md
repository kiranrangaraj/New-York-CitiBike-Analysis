# Citi Bike Sharing Analysis
The New York Citi Bike Sharing Program first began operations on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations. The stations were located in Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Initially the system launched with 6,000 bicycles and is the largest of such sharing programs in the United States. The program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on its utilization, where bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage each month.

This project involves aggregating data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs from November 2020 to build dashboards in order to illustrate unnexpected phenomena.
